C source file for ISA simulator 

Task 2: (Individual Work) Implement the ISA in a simulator written in C 
(or in another programming language of choice). The simulator must accept 
a file that encodes instructions of your ISA in binary (you can use a 
textual representation of the binary code, e.g., “00110010” in the file, 
or use the true binary file format), and print out the result. 
The simulator shouldn’t accept any other input.
